We are designing a real-time IoT system that allows vehicles to share essential data, including location, speed, and road conditions, to improve road safety and optimize traffic flow. The system should provide timely alerts for sudden stops, road hazards, or changes in traffic conditions, helping to prevent accidents and enhance the functionality of autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles.
